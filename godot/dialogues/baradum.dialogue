Baradum: Greetings, Greg the Garlic Farmer. I have come to see how you are doing with your preparations for the comedy night at the tavern.
Greg: Oh, hello, High Sorcerer Baradum. I'm doing fine, thank you. I have some jokes ready to tell to the audience.
Baradum: Really? Let me hear one of them.
Greg: Okay, okay. How about this one: What do you call a fish that wears a bowtie? Sofishticated.
Baradum: ...
Greg: ...
Baradum: That's your joke? That's the most unfunny joke I have ever heard. It's not sofishticated, it's sofishterrible.
Greg: Well, maybe you just don't get it. It's a clever pun on the words fish and sophisticated. You see, the fish wears a bowtie,
Greg: which is a sign of sophistication, and the word fish sounds like the suffix -ficated. So it's a wordplay. It's witty. It's smart. It's funny.
Baradum: No, Greg. It's not. It's stupid. It's dumb. It's unfunny. And so are you. You're the worst comedian ever.
Greg: That's not very nice, Baradum. That's mean.
Baradum: Oh, lighten up, Greg. It's just a bit of feedback. You know I love you, really.
Greg: Really?
Baradum: No, not really. Now go away and leave me alone. I have real quests to give to real adventurers. [shake rate=20 level=10]Portal away![/shake]
